1. Software Engineering: Software Engineering is the systematic and efficient process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software systems. 
This process involves using engineering principles, structured methods, and tools to create reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software products.

2. While Software Engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software by applying engineering principles, 
encompassing a broader scope than traditional programming. It involves a systematic process, including planning, analyzing requirements, designing solutions, 
testing, deploying, and maintaining software to ensure reliability, scalability, and user satisfaction. 

Traditional programming is less structured but software engineering applies methodologies and tools to manage complexity and ensure quality.  

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process consisting of planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, 
and maintenance phases. This cycle ensures a systematic approach to software development, promoting efficiency, quality, and sustainability, 
and differing from traditional programming in its focus on engineering principles and methodologies to meet specifications, ensure reliability, and meet user needs.

3. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing software, consisting of seven different phases:

1. Planning: Define project scope, goals, timeline, and resources.
2. Requirement Analysis: Gather and document software requirements from stakeholders.
3. Design: Create a detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
4. Implementation (Coding): Write the code based on design documents.
5. Testing: Verify and validate the software through various testing methods.
6. Deployment: Release the software to production, configure, and provide user training.
7. Maintenance: Monitor, update, and fix defects to ensure continued performance and reliability.

Each phase has specific goals and deliverables, ensuring a systematic approach to software development, promoting efficiency, quality, and sustainability.
Agile model embraces an iterative and incremental approach, breaking down projects into manageable sprints, adapting to changing requirements through collaborative 
efforts and continuous improvement, prioritizing customer satisfaction, and delivering functional software in short cycles. 
Waterfall Model follows a linear, sequential structure, completing each phase before progressing, relying on a rigid plan, and making changes challenging once the process begins, 
delivering the final product in a single release, emphasizing thorough documentation, and focusing on predictability and stability, defining requirements at the outset.
